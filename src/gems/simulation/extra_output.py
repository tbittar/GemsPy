"""
Extra output storage and vectorized evaluation.

Provides :class:`ExtraOutput` for storing post-solve expression values and
:class:`VectorizedExtraOutputBuilder`, a concrete subclass of
:class:`~gems.simulation.vectorized_builder.VectorizedBuilderBase` that
resolves ``VariableNode`` to an ``xr.DataArray`` of solved values, enabling
nonlinear operations (products of variables, floor, ceil, min, max) that
are not permitted during pre-solve constraint building.

Port arrays for ``sum_connections`` support are built by calling
:func:`~gems.simulation.linopy_problem.build_port_arrays` with a
:class:`VectorizedExtraOutputBuilder` factory.

    Evaluates a model-level extra output expression as a vectorized xr.DataArray.
