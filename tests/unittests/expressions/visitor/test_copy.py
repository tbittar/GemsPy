    Copying an AdditionNode with T operands must be O(T), not O(T²).

    Before the fix, CopyVisitor inherited the default addition() from
    ExpressionVisitorOperations which accumulated results with `res = res + o`.
    Each call to __add__ flattens the AdditionNode by copying the accumulated
    operand list, giving 1+2+...+(T-1) = O(T²) list copies in total.

    The fix overrides addition() in CopyVisitor to build AdditionNode directly
    from a list comprehension, reducing the cost to O(T).

    We verify linearity by checking that the time ratio between T=10_000 and
    T=1_000 stays below 20 (linear ≈ 10, quadratic ≈ 100).
