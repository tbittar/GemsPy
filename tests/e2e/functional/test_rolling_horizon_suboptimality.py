E2E test: rolling-horizon suboptimality and sequential carry-over (Issue #102).

System: 1 generator (p_max=2, gen_cost=1) + 1 load (oscillating demand)
        + 1 storage (capacity=2, max_rate=2, η=1, drop-mode SoC balance)
        + 1 bus (power balance with unserved-energy slack, ens_cost=100).

6 time steps (t=0..5):
  demand = [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4]   (zero at even steps, peak=4 at odd steps)

The generator alone (p_max=2) cannot cover the full peak demand of 4; the
storage must pre-charge during zero-demand steps so it can contribute 2 units
at each peak step.  Any demand not covered by gen+storage is handled by the
`unsupplied` variable in the bus at a penalty cost of 100/unit.

Sequential mode: block_length=3, block_overlap=1 → blocks [0,1,2], [2,3,4], [4,5].

─── Frontal optimal (total objective = 10) ───────────────────────────────────
With drop mode, SoC[t=0] is a free variable; the optimizer sets it to 2 at no
cost.  Zero-demand even steps are used to recharge the storage; peak odd steps
are served by gen=2 + discharge=2.  No unserved energy.

  t=0: gen=0, discharge=0, charge=0,  SoC=2  (free initial state)
  t=1: gen=2, discharge=2, charge=0,  SoC=0   cost = 2
  t=2: gen=2, discharge=0, charge=2,  SoC=2   cost = 2
  t=3: gen=2, discharge=2, charge=0,  SoC=0   cost = 2
  t=4: gen=2, discharge=0, charge=2,  SoC=2   cost = 2
  t=5: gen=2, discharge=2, charge=0,  SoC=0   cost = 2
  Total generation cost = 10; unserved = 0 → total objective = 10

─── Sequential suboptimality (sum of block objectives = 406) ─────────────────
Block 1 [0,1,2]: SoC[0]=2 free; serves t=1 with gen=2+discharge=2 (cost=2).
  t=2 is the look-ahead step with demand=0.  Within the window no future peak
  is visible, so the optimizer does not recharge → SoC[t=2]=0.
  → carry-over: SoC[t=2] = 0.   Block objective = 2.

Block 2 [2,3,4]: SoC[t=2]=0 fixed by carry-over.
  t=3: peak demand=4 but SoC=0 → gen=2, unsupplied=2.  Cost = 2 + 200 = 202.
  t=4 (look-ahead, demand=0): no recharge incentive → SoC[t=4]=0.
  → carry-over: SoC[t=4] = 0.   Block objective = 202.

Block 3 [4,5]: SoC[t=4]=0 fixed by carry-over.
  t=5: peak demand=4, same situation → gen=2, unsupplied=2. Cost = 2 + 200 = 202.
  Block objective = 202.

  Sum of block objectives = 2 + 202 + 202 = 406.
